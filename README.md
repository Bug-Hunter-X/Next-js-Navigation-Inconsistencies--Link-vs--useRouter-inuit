# Next.js Navigation Inconsistencies: Link vs. useRouter

This repository demonstrates a potential issue when mixing Next.js's `Link` component and the `useRouter` hook for navigation.  Using both without proper consideration can lead to unexpected behavior in terms of page transitions and overall navigation experience.

## Problem Description

The `bug.js` file shows an example where `Link` and `useRouter` are used independently. While functional, they offer different transition behaviors, which can be confusing for users and lead to a disjointed experience.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates a possible approach for standardization. It uses only the `Link` component for all navigation, leading to more consistent client-side transitions and reduced complexity.

## Recommendations

For optimal user experience and maintainability, it's best to consistently use either the `Link` component or `useRouter` across your application for internal navigation. Choosing a single method prevents inconsistent transition behaviors and simplifies code maintenance.
